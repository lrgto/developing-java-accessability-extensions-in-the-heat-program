<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

### Introduction

The Haskell language learning tool program HEAT lacks certain features that make it more accessible to people with visual impairments. We aimed to rectify this by implementing certain features based off research into various types of visual disabilities and develop an updated version of the program which is more user-friendly. In our development we implemented features that allow the user change the size of all the fonts within the program, the icon sizes of the all the toolbar icons, various colour profiles of the application to help users with different colour-blindness, and have all these features easily available on a new toolbar which can be hidden. We were unable to implement further features, such as text to speech, and discovered some minor, but non-program breaking bugs, which in the future can be fixed and improved.

The Java based program HEAT (Haskell Educational Advancement Tool) is designed as a teaching tool for the Haskell programming language. The program serves this purpose via a basic minimal GUI that has many limitations when considering accessibility features for users with visual disabilities, such as partial or complete blindness. Such features consist of; text scaling, dark mode, other colour modes, invert contrast, GUI scaling, button/ icons scaling, text to speech, such features are addressed in the User Stories as issues needed addressing during this first sprint. In 5 days, we expect to address over half of the user stories and create a fully functioning features within the program with minimal bugs/ issues without interrupting the original functionality of the HEAT program.

We were able to implement several features into HEAT, as well as updating fonts and sizes, that would make the program more accessible to users with visual impairments. We were able to complete 8 of our 9 user stories, the only one of which we did not being Text to Speech, however if we had some more time this would have been something we would have tried to implement. The 8 we did complete run successfully and our approach went smoothly. We were able to work well as a team, and our methodology of using SCRUM and the various Quality Assurance techniques utilised helped us to complete these features in time and deliver a working product. Given more time we would like to address a few bugs that were created, however as they do not break the program, this is something we would fix in the future, as well as implementing more features to further assist users.
